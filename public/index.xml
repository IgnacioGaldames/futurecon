      <description>Save the date! The second edition of the FutureCon is scheduled to take place from September the 3rd to the 5th of 2021.
This year we want to engage with even more native innovators and storytellers that make Science Fiction happen and flourish in their own language and markets. We want to build the tools that will reshape our own imagination, set up creative networks, and make room for independent voices, crafting publishing alternatives and self-sustainable connections to “decolonize the future”.</description>
