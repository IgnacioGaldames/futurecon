			<p>Save the date! The second edition of the FutureCon is scheduled to take place from September the 3rd to the 5th of 2021.</p>
<p>This year we want to engage with even more native innovators and storytellers that make Science Fiction happen and flourish in their own language and markets. We want to build the tools that will reshape our own imagination, set up creative networks, and make room for independent voices, crafting publishing alternatives and self-sustainable connections to “decolonize the future”.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-happens-everywhere">The future happens everywhere</h2>
<p>William Gibson once said that the future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed. Geographical location and wealth could indeed limit access to considerable advances in technology. However, imagination is a more subtle power. It does not know borders or languages. From Beijing to Lagos, from Rio de Janeiro to Los Angeles, ideas are flourishing in the form of stories.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, a worldwide pandemic demands realists of a larger reality. So we reach out to you with our voices from all over the world through our devices. The time has come to draw attention to Science Fiction stories written all over the planet — stories made of different languages, colors, shapes, hopes, and beliefs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The future happens everywhere. That’s why we are here.</strong></p>
